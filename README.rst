Installation
============

.. code:: bash

   $ python3 -m pip install corpy

Only recent versions of Python 3 (3.10+) are supported by design.

Help and feedback
=================

If you get stuck, it's always a good idea to start by searching the
documentation, the short URL to which is https://corpy.rtfd.io/.

The project is developed on GitHub_. You can ask for help via `GitHub
discussions`_ and report bugs and give other kinds of feedback via `GitHub
issues`_. Support is provided gladly, time and other engagements permitting, but
cannot be guaranteed.

What is CorPy?
==============

A fancy plural for *corpus* ;) Also, a collection of handy but not especially
mutually integrated tools for dealing with linguistic data. It abstracts away
functionality which is often needed in practice for teaching and/or day to day
work at the `Czech National Corpus <https://korpus.cz>`__, without aspiring to
be a fully featured or consistent NLP framework.

Here's an idea of what you can do with CorPy:

- add linguistic annotation to raw textual data using either `UDPipe
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/udpipe.html>`__ or `MorphoDiTa
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/morphodita.html>`__
- `easily generate word clouds
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/vis.html>`__
- run code in `a sanitized global environment
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/no_globals.html>`__ (useful for
  debugging in interactive sessions, e.g. with Jupyter notebooks in `JupyterLab
  <https://jupyterlab.rtfd.io>`__)
- `generate phonetic transcripts of Czech texts
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/phonetics_cs.html>`__
- `wrangle corpora in the vertical format
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/vertical.html>`__ devised originally
  for `CWB <http://cwb.sourceforge.net/>`__, used also by `(No)SketchEngine
  <https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/trac/noske/>`__
- plus some `command line utilities
  <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/cli.html>`__

.. note::

   **Should I pick UDPipe or MorphoDiTa?**

   Both are developed at `ÚFAL MFF UK`_. UDPipe_ has more features at the cost
   of being somewhat more complex: it does both `morphological tagging
   (including lemmatization) and syntactic parsing
   <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/udpipe.html>`__, and it handles a
   number of different input and output formats. You can also download
   `pre-trained models <http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/models>`__ for many
   different languages.

   By contrast, MorphoDiTa_ only has `pre-trained models for Czech and English
   <http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita/users-manual>`__, and only performs
   `morphological tagging (including lemmatization)
   <https://corpy.rtfd.io/en/stable/guides/morphodita.html>`__. However, its
   output is more straightforward -- it just splits your text into tokens and
   annotates them, whereas UDPipe can (depending on the model) introduce
   additional tokens necessary for a more explicit analysis, add multi-word
   tokens etc. This is because UDPipe is tailored to the type of linguistic
   analysis conducted within the UniversalDependencies_ project, using the
   CoNLL-U_ data format.

   MorphoDiTa can also help you if you just want to tokenize text and don't have
   a language model available.

Development
===========

Dependencies and building the docs
----------------------------------

``corpy`` needs to be installed in the ReadTheDocs virtualenv for ``autodoc`` to
work. The optional dependencies in the ``doc`` group are also needed. This is
all configured in ``.readthedocs.yml``.
