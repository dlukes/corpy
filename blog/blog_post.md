Custom Python iterators and generators: when to use which

â†’ DO THIS AS A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK!

# Quick summary

Implementing an iterator with __iter__? What you actually need may be a
subclass of `collections.abc.Generator` instead.

# Intro

Iterators vs. generators (generator functions vs generator iterators) vs. iterables.

https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html

Generator-iterator API: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator.throw

# Use case

Native extension API which we want to write a Pythonic wrapper for.

Python: Resume an __iter__()-based iterator like a generator

Generators can be resumed:

```python
from itertools import islice

def four_gen_iterfunc():
    yield from range(4)

fg = four_gen_iterfunc()
print(list(islice(fg, 2)))
# prints [0, 1]
print(list(islice(fg, 2)))
# prints [2, 3]
```

But as far as I'm aware, `__iter__()`-based iterators cannot:

```python
class FourIterator:

    def __init__(self):
        def gen():
            
        self._gen_iter = (i for i in range(4))

    def __iter__(self):
        yield from self._gen_iter

fc = FourIterator()
print(list(islice(fc, 2)))
# prints [0, 1]
print(list(islice(fc, 2)))
# prints [0, 1] again, because the iterator is reinitialized
```

Of course, this makes sense when you consider that using such a class in an
iterable context results in a **call** to its `__iter__()` method, i.e. each
use corresponds to a call.

This is confusing because superficially, when used as iterables, the syntax is
the same for both generators and `__iter__()`-iterators (see calls to
`islice()` above).

Can you see any immediate drawbacks to such an approach? Are you aware of any
previous discussions along this line of reasoning that you could point me to?
Thanks!

Also, props to this answer on SO for pointing me to
`collections.abc.Generator`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42983569/how-to-write-a-generator-class

But conceptually, this is a generator:

- should be able to call `next()`
- also, different expectations re: what happens when iteration ends:
  - iterator: can restart by putting in an iterable context
  - generator: will be empty on subsequent attempts to iterate over

Subclass `collections.abc.Generator` instead!

```python
from collections.abc import Generator


class FourGenerator(Generator):

    def __init__(self):
        # iter(range) nejde, 'range_iterator' object has no attribute 'send'
        self._gen_iter = (i for i in range(4))

    def send(self, value):
        # or just next(self._gen_iter), if you're sure you don't care about what value the underlying
        # generator receives
        return self._gen_iter.send(value)

    def throw(self, typ, val=None, tb=None):
        self._gen_iter.throw(typ, val, tb)


fg = FourGenerator()
print(list(islice(fg, 2)))
print(list(islice(fg, 2)))
```
