    """Run a block of code in a sanitized global environment.

    A context manager which temporarily removes global variables from scope:

    >>> foo = 42
    >>> with clean_env():
    ...     foo
    ...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NameError: name 'foo' is not defined

    The original environment is restored at the end of the block:

    >>> foo
    42

    Also works as a decorator, which is like wrapping the entire function body
    with the context manager:

    >>> @clean_env()
    ... def return_foo():
    ...     return foo
    ...
    >>> return_foo()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    NameError: name 'foo' is not defined

    By default, `clean_env` tries to be clever and leave e.g. functions alone,
    as well as other objects which are likely to be "legitimate" globals. It
    also restores overwritten builtins.

    This is useful e.g. for testing answers in student assignments, because it
    will ensure that functions which accidentally capture global variables
    instead of using arguments fail.

    :param blacklist: A list of global variable names to always remove,
        irrespective of the other options.
    :param whitelist: A list of global variable names to always keep,
        irrespective of the other options.
    :param strict: In non-strict mode, allow global variables in the current
        scope, i.e. only start pruning within function calls. NOTE: This is
        slower because it requires tracing the function calls. Also, when using
        `clean_env` as a function decorator, non-strict probably doesn't make
        sense.
    :param restore_builtins: Make sure that the conventional names for built-in
        objects point to those objects (beginners often use ``list`` or
        ``sorted`` as variable names).
    :param modules: Prune variables which refer to modules.
    :param callables: Prune variables which refer to callables.
    :param upper: Prune variables with all-uppercase identifiers (underscores
        allowed), which are likely to be intentional global variables (constants
        and the like).
    :param dunder: Prune variables whose name starts with a double underscore.
    :param sunder: Prune variables whose name starts with a single underscore.
