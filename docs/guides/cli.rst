Command line scripts
====================

CorPy also comes with a few (possibly) handy command line utilities:

- ``xc``: Prints frequency information about extended grapheme clusters in text
  files.
- ``zip-verticals``: Zips two verticals of the same corpus with different
  positional attributes together.

Run them with the ``--help`` option to get usage instructions.
